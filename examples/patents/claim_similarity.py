Patent Claim Similarity Analysis Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Patsnap Python SDK to analyze the similarity
between two patent claim texts using deep learning models.

The claim similarity API can accurately identify similarities in technical features,
structural composition, and expression methods of claims, supporting both Chinese
and English claim texts.

Similarity Score Interpretation:
- Above 0.8: High similarity
- 0.6-0.8: Moderate similarity  
- Below 0.6: Low similarity
